              My name is Zuzana. I am a woman, a mother of two sons, and a guide
              through a woman's inner world on her journey back to herself. I
              love yoga, dance, nature, and beauty in all its forms. I am
              fascinated by the depths of the human psyche and the spiritual
              dimensions of our being, and I look for ways to bridge them with
              the material world so they can support each other and create a
              harmonious whole.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutme-paragraph">
              Around the time my second son was born in 2017, I began to undergo
              a deep awakening and my own inner transformation. During the
              following years, I went through burnout, the end of my marriage,
              and the complete collapse of my life as I had known it until then.
              I was forced to feel a multitude of heavy emotions that I had
              previously avoided and to re-evaluate my approach to myself and to
              life itself. I had to admit where I hadn't been living truly in
              alignment with my truth. I began to accept all my long-suppressed
              parts, trying to understand and integrate them.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutme-paragraph">
              Throughout this process, I sought help and tried various methods
              of inner healing, self-development, and conscious manifestation...
              The Journey Therapy proved to be the most effective and
              comprehensive for me. Thanks to it, I more clearly realized and
              processed traumas from my childhood as well as from the deeper
              past of my soul. I understood many karmic connections. I
              discovered negative beliefs that had been subtly influencing my
              reality without me even realizing it. I came to understand that my
              old life fell apart because it wasn't in alignment with who I
              truly am. I also realized that the outer world is a reflection of
              the inner one, and if I want to change something on the outside, I
              must first change it within myself.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutme-paragraph">
              I began to perceive and understand my body, my heart, and my mind
              more intensely. I connected more firmly to my inner guidance. I
              saw how I had been losing this connection and how to regain
              it—lovingly, with understanding, acceptance, and forgiveness. And
              perhaps the most beautiful part—I learned to experience myself in
              my purest form, as an inseparable part of the Source of this life,
              the infinite energy of love and consciousness.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutme-paragraph">
              My main theme in this incarnation is feminine energy at all levels
              of being, as well as its relationship with masculine energy. I
              observe that despite all the freedom and emancipation women have
              today, they often do not live lives in which they are healthy,
              beautiful, and fulfilled. They are held back by their inner
              settings. I would like to help them change these settings so they
              can consciously create their reality in harmony with their natural
              energy, discover their deepest gifts, and enjoy life to the
              fullest—with body, heart, and soul."
            </p>
            <p class="aboutme-paragraph">
              My wish is for women to be healthy, beautiful, and fulfilled...
              connected to their inner guidance... to dance in their natural
              energy... to discover and share their deepest gifts... and to
              fully enjoy life with body, heart, and soul. To live in love on
              Earth.

        <h2>About the Method Ways</h2>

        <p class="paragraph abouttherapy-paragraph">
          The Journey method was developed by the internationally acclaimed
          therapist, teacher, and author, Brandon Bays. It originated from her
          own life experience, where she managed to heal a tumor the size of a
          basketball within 7 weeks. She describes her story in the book The
          Journey. It is a simple but highly effective technique based on
          releasing old emotional wounds and initiating the body's self-healing
          process.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph abouttherapy-paragraph">
          It is scientifically proven that emotions trigger biochemical
          reactions in our bodies. When they are suppressed, cellular receptors
          become blocked, disrupting healthy communication between cells. This
          creates a disorder in the body, which is initially hidden but can
          eventually develop into an illness precisely at the site of these
          blocked cellular receptors. A large part of these blockages originates
          in early childhood and manifests both as a predisposition to certain
          health problems and as negative psychological programming—we carry
          various conclusions and beliefs from unprocessed traumatic experiences
          that then impede the natural flow of our lives and the fulfillment of
          our potential.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph abouttherapy-paragraph">
          During therapy, there is a re-experiencing and release of suppressed
          emotions and the uncovering of related cellular memories, which are
          the root cause of the client's difficulties. These memories are
          processed in a way that leads to inner reconciliation and forgiveness.
          The client simultaneously finds a path to a deep inner experience of
          peace, unity, love, and fulfillment.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph abouttherapy-paragraph">
          I personally was captivated by this method due to its ability to
          integrate the body, mind, and spirit into one whole, and to work on
          all planes simultaneously. During my own therapy sessions, I began to
          realize how the very same problem was reflected everywhere in some
          way. As a physical illness, an unpleasant emotional state, a negative
          thought pattern, a blockage in self-realization, and spiritual
          development. It is fascinating to observe how it dissolves on each of
          these levels, the person becomes liberated, and new possibilities of
          being and creating in this world open up for them.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph abouttherapy-paragraph">
          Another huge advantage of this method is that it utilizes various
          tools and combines them into one coherent therapeutic process. Within
          this process, it can release suppressed emotions, process a traumatic
          event, uncover its connection to other events in the person's life,
          initiate healing at the physical level, understand and heal
          relationships with other people, uncover and rewrite negative beliefs,
          provide the client with deep relaxation, an experience of safety and
          unconditional loving acceptance, and in some cases, even look into
          past lives, thus tracing the soul's journey through various
          incarnations.

      <h2>My offer</h2>
      <p class="paragraph abouttherapy-paragraph">
        I use The Journey method as a therapeutic tool. One session lasts
        approximately 3 hours, and the first one is preceded by a short video
        call during which we get to know each other, find out if our energies
        resonate, discuss the process and conditions in more detail, and there
        will be space for your questions. This call is free of charge. The
        therapy itself usually takes place online, but it is also possible to
        arrange a personal meeting in Prague.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph abouttherapy-paragraph">
        I primarily offer my clients a safe environment full of acceptance and
        support. My priority is to create a space where it is possible to relax,
        trust, and open up as deeply as possible to the healing process.
        <br /><br />

        Therapy can be a one-off session, or offered in packages of five and
        ten.
      </p>

      <ul class="myoffer-list">
        <li>
          One Standalone Therapy: This is suitable if there is something acute
          happening in the client's life that requires space for sufficient
          emotional release and processing of a specific event. It is also good
          for someone who is generally progressing in life but feels that
          something is blocked, which they cannot resolve on their own.
        </li>
        <li>
          Package of Five Therapies: This provides space to process a topic
          deeper and more thoroughly, from various angles and at multiple levels
          of being. This may involve a chronic health problem or an area of life
          where one is struggling.
        </li>
        <li>
          Package of Ten Therapies: This is suitable for someone who wants to
          work on themselves long-term—shedding old traumas and limitations,
          various ego programs, and consciously transforming their life. To
          discover their deeper potential and walk towards greater freedom and
          authenticity.
