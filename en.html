              My name is Zuzana. I am a woman, a mother of two sons, and a guide
              through a woman's inner world on her journey back to herself. I
              love yoga, dance, nature, and beauty in all its forms. I am
              fascinated by the depths of the human psyche and the spiritual
              dimensions of our being, and I look for ways to bridge them with
              the material world so they can support each other and create a
              harmonious whole.

            <p class="aboutme-paragraph">
              Around the time my second son was born, I began to undergo a deep
              awakening and my own inner transformation. During the following
              years, I went through burnout, the end of my marriage, and the
              complete collapse of my life as I had known it until then. I was
              forced to feel a multitude of heavy emotions that I had previously
              avoided and to re-evaluate my approach to myself and to life
              itself. I had to admit where I hadn't been living truly in
              alignment with my truth. I began to accept all my long-suppressed
              parts, trying to understand and integrate them.

            <p class="aboutme-paragraph">
              Throughout this process, I sought help and tried various methods
              of inner healing, self-development, and conscious manifestation...
              The Journey Therapy proved to be the most effective and
              comprehensive for me. Thanks to it, I more clearly realized and
              processed traumas from my childhood as well as from the deeper
              past of my soul. I understood many karmic connections. I
              discovered negative beliefs that had been subtly influencing my
              reality without me even realizing it. I came to understand that my
              old life fell apart because it wasn't in alignment with who I
              truly am. I also realized that the outer world is a reflection of
              the inner one, and if I want to change something on the outside, I
              must first change it within myself.

              I began to perceive and understand my body, my heart, and my mind
              more intensely. I connected more firmly to my inner guidance. I
              saw how I had been losing this connection and how to regain
              it—lovingly, with understanding, acceptance, and forgiveness. And
              perhaps the most beautiful part—I learned to experience myself in
              my purest form, as an inseparable part of the Source of this life,
              the infinite energy of love and consciousness.

        <h2>About The Journey Method</h2>

        <p class="paragraph abouttherapy-paragraph">
          The Journey Therapy was developed by the internationally acclaimed
          therapist, teacher, and author, Brandon Bays. It originated from her
          own life experience, where she managed to heal a tumor the size of a
          basketball within 7 weeks. She describes her story in the book The
          Journey. It is a simple but highly effective technique based on
          releasing old emotional wounds and initiating the body's self-healing
          process.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph abouttherapy-paragraph">
          It is scientifically proven that emotions trigger biochemical
          reactions in our bodies. When they are suppressed, cellular receptors
          become blocked, disrupting healthy communication between cells. This
          creates a disorder in the body, which is initially hidden but can
          eventually develop into an illness precisely at the site of these
          blocked cellular receptors. A large part of these blockages originates
          in early childhood and manifests both as a predisposition to certain
          health problems and as negative psychological programming—we carry
          various conclusions and beliefs from unprocessed traumatic experiences
          that then impede the natural flow of our lives and the fulfillment of
          our potential.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph abouttherapy-paragraph">
          During therapy, there is a re-experiencing and release of suppressed
          emotions and the uncovering of related cellular memories, which are
          the root cause of the client's difficulties. These memories are
          processed in a way that leads to inner reconciliation and forgiveness.
          The client simultaneously finds a path to a deep inner experience of
          peace, unity, love, and fulfillment.

        <span class="bold">The Journey therapy</span> as my primary tool. Using

        One session lasts approximately 2.5 to 3 hours. The first session is
        preceded by a short video call, during which we can introduce ourselves,
        see if our energies resonate, and discuss the therapeutic process in
        more detail. There will also be space for your questions. This initial
        call is free of charge. The therapy itself usually takes place online,
        but it is also possible to arrange a face-to-face meeting in Prague.

        &quot;I reached out to Zuzka because I was facing problems in my life. I
        was forced to move out of the home I shared with my husband, I was alone
        with my two children, and I had trouble walking—my legs weren&#39;t
        serving me as they used to. I was without energy, mentally and
        physically exhausted, and still recovering from whooping cough. I was
        trying to resolve my situation—to get back on my feet both health-wise
        and physically. Zuzka led me through her &#39;Journey&#39; and I felt a
        huge sense of relief. She was a guide on my inner path to understanding
        my situation and the consequences of what happened to me. I resolved
        everything internally, negative emotions were released, and I understood
        the cause of my problems. After the process with Zuzka, I felt
        completely light and charged with energy. I discovered many things I
        need to change so that this doesn&#39;t repeat. I would recommend this
        service to people who want to resolve their problems within 1–2
        sessions. Zuzka is a professional and very kind woman; everything is
        based on mutual agreement, and sessions can be held online or in
        person.&quot; Hanka
