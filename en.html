              My name is Zuzana. I am a woman, a mother of two sons, and a guide
              through a woman's inner world on her journey back to herself. I
              love yoga, dance, nature, and beauty in all its forms. I am
              fascinated by the depths of the human psyche and the spiritual
              dimensions of our being, and I look for ways to bridge them with
              the material world so they can support each other and create a
              harmonious whole.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutme-paragraph">
              Around the time my second son was born in 2017, I began to undergo
              a deep awakening and my own inner transformation. During the
              following years, I went through burnout, the end of my marriage,
              and the complete collapse of my life as I had known it until then.
              I was forced to feel a multitude of heavy emotions that I had
              previously avoided and to re-evaluate my approach to myself and to
              life itself. I had to admit where I hadn't been living truly in
              alignment with my truth. I began to accept all my long-suppressed
              parts, trying to understand and integrate them.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutme-paragraph">
              Throughout this process, I sought help and tried various methods
              of inner healing, self-development, and conscious manifestation...
              The Journey Therapy proved to be the most effective and
              comprehensive for me. Thanks to it, I more clearly realized and
              processed traumas from my childhood as well as from the deeper
              past of my soul. I understood many karmic connections. I
              discovered negative beliefs that had been subtly influencing my
              reality without me even realizing it. I came to understand that my
              old life fell apart because it wasn't in alignment with who I
              truly am. I also realized that the outer world is a reflection of
              the inner one, and if I want to change something on the outside, I
              must first change it within myself.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutme-paragraph">
              I began to perceive and understand my body, my heart, and my mind
              more intensely. I connected more firmly to my inner guidance. I
              saw how I had been losing this connection and how to regain
              it—lovingly, with understanding, acceptance, and forgiveness. And
              perhaps the most beautiful part—I learned to experience myself in
              my purest form, as an inseparable part of the Source of this life,
              the infinite energy of love and consciousness.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutme-paragraph">
              My main theme in this incarnation is feminine energy at all levels
              of being, as well as its relationship with masculine energy. I
              observe that despite all the freedom and emancipation women have
              today, they often do not live lives in which they are healthy,
              beautiful, and fulfilled. They are held back by their inner
              settings. I would like to help them change these settings so they
              can consciously create their reality in harmony with their natural
              energy, discover their deepest gifts, and enjoy life to the
              fullest—with body, heart, and soul.

        <h2>About The Journey Method</h2>

        <p class="paragraph abouttherapy-paragraph">
          The Journey Therapy was developed by the internationally acclaimed
          therapist, teacher, and author, Brandon Bays. It originated from her
          own life experience, where she managed to heal a tumor the size of a
          basketball within 7 weeks. She describes her story in the book The
          Journey. It is a simple but highly effective technique based on
          releasing old emotional wounds and initiating the body's self-healing
          process.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph abouttherapy-paragraph">
          It is scientifically proven that emotions trigger biochemical
          reactions in our bodies. When they are suppressed, cellular receptors
          become blocked, disrupting healthy communication between cells. This
          creates a disorder in the body, which is initially hidden but can
          eventually develop into an illness precisely at the site of these
          blocked cellular receptors. A large part of these blockages originates
          in early childhood and manifests both as a predisposition to certain
          health problems and as negative psychological programming—we carry
          various conclusions and beliefs from unprocessed traumatic experiences
          that then impede the natural flow of our lives and the fulfillment of
          our potential.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph abouttherapy-paragraph">
          During therapy, there is a re-experiencing and release of suppressed
          emotions and the uncovering of related cellular memories, which are
          the root cause of the client's difficulties. These memories are
          processed in a way that leads to inner reconciliation and forgiveness.
          The client simultaneously finds a path to a deep inner experience of
          peace, unity, love, and fulfillment.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph abouttherapy-paragraph">
          I personally was captivated by this method due to its ability to
          integrate the body, mind, and spirit into one whole, and to work on
          all planes simultaneously. During my own therapy sessions, I began to
          realize how the very same problem was reflected everywhere in some
          way. As a physical illness, an unpleasant emotional state, a negative
          thought pattern, a blockage in self-realization, and spiritual
          development. It is fascinating to observe how it dissolves on each of
          these levels, the person becomes liberated, and new possibilities of
          being and creating in this world open up for them.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph abouttherapy-paragraph">
          Another huge advantage of this method is that it utilizes various
          tools and combines them into one coherent therapeutic process. Within
          this process, it can release suppressed emotions, process a traumatic
          event, uncover its connection to other events in the person's life,
          initiate healing at the physical level, understand and heal
          relationships with other people, uncover and rewrite negative beliefs,
          provide the client with deep relaxation, an experience of safety and
          unconditional loving acceptance, and in some cases, even look into
          past lives, thus tracing the soul's journey through various
          incarnations.

        transformation process. I use <strong>The Journey therapy</strong> as my

        One session lasts approximately 2.5 to 3 hours. The first session is
        preceded by a short video call, during which we can introduce ourselves,
        see if our energies resonate, and discuss the therapeutic process in

        call is free of charge. The therapy itself usually takes place online,

      <p>
        &quot;I want to thank Zuzka for guiding me on my journey through life.
        It is wonderful to feel such support, guidance, and security from such
        an empathetic person. Zuzka has a gift for helping one open up their
        hidden shadows, shining a light on them, and bringing them to the
        surface. Yes, it is painful, but immensely healing. Zuzi, you are doing
        a great job, please keep going. I know you will help thousands of people
        unlock the potential they have within them. I look forward to our next
        therapy session because I know that with you, I can do it.&quot; Janka
      </p>

      <p>
        &quot;I am a mother on maternity leave with two children, and after
        several years of caring for my family, I’m finally starting to think
        about myself. Before therapy, I was at the very beginning of a journey
        toward self-awareness, recognizing my own needs, and admitting to
        certain traumas from the past related to my mother. I had my doubts
        because it isn’t easy to find time for oneself in an environment where
        children are constantly present, which makes me extremely critical of
        everything. Zuzka is a pleasant guide through the inner world with great
        patience. Thanks to the projection and the journey we took together, I
        became aware of my inner child, who still helps me today in difficult
        moments by reminding me to be kind to myself. I would recommend this
        therapy to anyone who wants to deepen their connection with their inner
        consciousness. Having a guide helped me tremendously.&quot; Terezka

        &quot;I met Zuzka through my son, and I immediately felt that we
        clicked, and not just as mothers. When I felt stuck in certain life
        situations, I didn&#39;t hesitate to trust her and let her guide me
        through &#39;The Journey&#39; (Cesta) therapy. Her kind and patient
        guidance allowed me to look at what is stored deep inside me without
        fear and to &#39;shine a light&#39; on the unconscious patterns I was
        operating from. Thanks to Zuzka, I was able to define new, beneficial
        patterns for how I want to live. Because of this, I was able to move
        forward in my life. I am very grateful for that. Thank you.&quot;

        &quot;I completed several sessions with Zuzka. Everything was pleasant
        and professional, and although we reached great depths, I felt I was in
        good hands and in a safe space the entire time. &#39;The Journey&#39;
        therapy is a great way to quickly get to the core of a problem—sometimes
        one I didn&#39;t even know I had. Zuzka knows how to guide a person
        kindly and directly to the origin, where things can be brought to
        consciousness and settled. I definitely recommend her as a therapist to
        those who want a guide on the path to a new way of being
        <span class="symbol-heart">❤️</span>.&quot; Katka

      <p>
        &quot;I reached out to Zuzka because I was facing problems in my life. I
        was forced to move out of the home I shared with my husband, I was alone
        with my two children, and I had trouble walking—my legs weren&#39;t
        serving me as they used to. I was without energy, mentally and
        physically exhausted, and still recovering from whooping cough. I was
        trying to resolve my situation—to get back on my feet both health-wise
        and physically. Zuzka led me through her &#39;Journey&#39; and I felt a
        huge sense of relief. She was a guide on my inner path to understanding
        my situation and the consequences of what happened to me. I resolved
        everything internally, negative emotions were released, and I understood
        the cause of my problems. After the process with Zuzka, I felt
        completely light and charged with energy. I discovered many things I
        need to change so that this doesn&#39;t repeat. I would recommend this
        service to people who want to resolve their problems within 1–2
        sessions. Zuzka is a professional and very kind woman; everything is
        based on mutual agreement, and sessions can be held online or in
        person.&quot; Hanka
